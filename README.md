# AKT Profile for Magsik
AKT Profile by Asiier & Senthil360 for Magisk in order to use post-fs-data.d.

###Is this necessary?
I can't fully mount the /system partition and so /system/etc/init.d/99AKT is not editable.
The result is that at each boot/reboot I have to go through the whole procedure to apply the setting.

This module should make things easier: instead of rely on init.d, it uses the built-in function of magisk.
